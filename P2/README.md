# COP290: Assignment 1 Subtask 2

## About:
The tar file contains one C++ code file and one make file along with one image extracted from the video- ```bg.jpg``` which is used as a background.

We have also added our output as ```out.txt``` and the chart based on this data as ```Traffic_Density.png```.


## How to Run the Code:
1. Put the code file and Makefile along with the background image in the same folder.
2. Run 
    ```
    make
    ```
3. Run 
    ```
    ./output video
    ``` 
    where video = ```trafficvideo``` or any other suitable video file of mp4 type. 

4. Three values will be printed on the console- 
    ```
    Time(in seconds) Queue Density Dynamic Density
    ```
5. For user's convienence, the above printed values is stored in a csv file named as- ```output.csv```.
